# Dataset 2 - Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing

The dataset is RNA Sequencing data of  4 PCOS and 3 control cells sample, aim of this study to compare the transcriptome expression of cumulus granulosa cells between PCOS patients with insulin resistance and women undergoing assisted reproduction for fallopian tube reasons. The data sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 3000 (Homo sapiens) (GEO accesion number: GSE216609).

The analysis of the dataset initiated with the retrieval of raw data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using sample IDs. Subsequently, preprocessing of the data commenced by downloading the raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format. Quality control was conducted using the FastQC toolkit to assess data quality and identify potential overrepresented adapter sequences. Following this, a trimming step utilizing TRIMMOMATIC removed adapter sequences and low-quality regions from the reads. A secondary FastQC analysis verified the effectiveness of the trimming process in enhancing data quality and reducing noise. Once preprocessed, the GTF file for Homo sapiens were loaded, and the GTF file was converted to RNA sequences in FASTA format. This sequence information was employed for mapping the RNA-seq data using the pseudo-aligner KALLISTO. These steps were performed on the HPC of Ghent University.

The resulting pseudo-count data was adjusted for transcript length and summarized to the gene level using genome annotation, as we are not interested in differential transcript analysis but differential gene analysis. A library size normalization (TMM) and filtering step were then applied.

To address the notable differences in library size between samples, voom with quality weights was used to analyze the preprocessed data. After this, differential gene expression analysis was performed by fitting a model with no intercept using limma. Differential expression analysis was carried out using the limma package, involving the creation of a design matrix without intercept, linear model fitting, and identification of top genes through the eBayes method. Following this, differential gene expression analysis was performed by fitting a model with no intercept using limma. Adjusted p-values for the differential expression analysis were calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. 

For gene set analysis, an identical methodology was applied to ensure consistency across datasets. Goana was employed to identify over-represented Pathways (KEGG) and Gene Ontology: Molecular Function terms among the top 300 genes, selected based on p-value and logFC, akin to the approach used in the previous dataset. Goana's consideration of gene length is important for sequencing data, where genes with higher lengths were more likely to have elevated counts, potentially leading to more differentially expressed results.
