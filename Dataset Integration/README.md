# Integrating the results of the 4 datasets
To integrate findings across the four datasets, a comprehensive approach was employed to identify similarities in differently expressed genes. To ensure a robust comparison between differently expressed genes, we employed a 'threshold' approach based on the dataset with the highest number of differently expressed genes. The number of differently expressed genes from this dataset served as the threshold, and an equivalent subset was selected from each dataset. These subsets were then overlapped and compared using Gene Symbol to identify shared elements and assess the degree of similarity across the datasets. This approach allows us to identify consistently differently expressed genes enhancing the reliability and coherence of our integrated results.
