# Dataset 3 - Expression profiling by array

The dataset is Microarray expression data derived from ovaries of 12 women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and 24 Female to Male Transexual individuals after treatment with Testosterone (GEO accesion number: GSE87435).

A gene expression microarray is utilized to determine differential expression analysis between PCOS samples and Female to Male Transexual individuals after treatment with Testosterone samples. Dataset includes two batches which are Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array and Affymetrix Human Genome U133B Array, only first batch was used. The expression levels from the Affymetrix microarray data were normalized and summarized using the Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) technique. RMA is a preferred preprocessing technique for microarray data that includes summarizing probe intensities, quantile normalization, and background correction to provide expression values with the arrayQualityMetrics package, quality control metrics are calculated before and after preprocessing. Subsequently, differential expression is tested with the limma package. Finally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis is performed by goana function, but with a 0.05 cut-off. More details on this subject can be found in the results sections.
